# Auto-Clicker
A simple python auto clicker for your mouse.

### Description
Tired of alot malicious prograns in the internet, I decided to make my on program,
free of suspicios codes.

This code will make yours mouse fire clicks as fast as it can.

For the current version of the program, the default TOGGLE_KEY is "p".
You can change it by your own in the [clicker.py](./clicker.py#L6).

### Running the program
For this version, you can simplaly run [clicker.py](./clicker.py) and kill the task after get tired of using it.
Don't forget to install the requirements, just follow the [instrunctions](./INSTALL.md)
